# Book Manager App

## Description

A simple Flutter application for searching books using the Google Books API, saving favorite books locally using SQLite, and viewing/managing the list of favorites.

## Features

- Search for books by keyword using the Google Books API.
- View book details including title, author, and cover image.
- Add/remove books to a local favorites list.
- View the list of favorite books.
- Delete books from the favorites list.

## Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ouma49/APP_Books_Manager_flutter.git
    cd books_manager
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    Navigate to the project root in your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

    The necessary packages (`http`, `sqflite`, `path`) should be automatically added if you haven't already added them manually.

3.  **Run the application:**

    Make sure you have a Flutter-compatible device or emulator connected and running. You can list connected devices using `flutter devices`.

    To launch the app on a specific device (replace `<device_id>` with your emulator or device ID):

    ```bash
    flutter run -d <device_id>
    ```

    If you don't have an emulator running, you can list available emulators with `flutter emulators` and launch one with `flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>`.
